The upstream powertop android support is pretty broken currently.  Changes here
fix it.  They include:

major changes:
- Android.mk fixes for our libraries, and various file issues
- don't use i18n
- don't use C++ try/catch
- mbstowcs() call acts differently, postpend some space in a different way

couple other minor tweaks for android differences.

also have to create css.h when updating upstream, like:
cd src
./csstoh.sh powertop.css css.h
